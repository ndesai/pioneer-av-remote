# Pioneer AV Remote
### iOS
##### Qt/QML


This application is meant as an open-source alternative to Pioneer's Control App.

The latest official Pioneer Control App update seems to have broken both the iOS and Android apps' ability to connect to my receiver (VSX-822-K). This app has solved this issue. It is much faster at connecting to your receiver than Pioneer's official Control App. 

**A few features are still remaining, the biggest is service discovery to automagically find your local network receiver; currently you will have to add the hostname / ip and port number in the settings menu.**

Hostnames can be configured as such:

```
VSX-822.local
[model-number].local
```
