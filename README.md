# Pioneer AV Remote
### iOS
##### Qt/QML


This application is meant as an open-source alternative to Pioneer's Control App.

The latest Pioneer Control App update seems to have broken both the iOS and Android apps' ability to connect to my receiver (VSX-822-K)

Hostnames can be configured as such:

```
VSX-822.local
[model-number].local
```
